## Challenges Overview

1. **ArtifactVault**: Implemented an array-based storage for artifacts, allowing addition, removal, and searching using linear and binary search.
   
2. **LabyrinthPath**: Created a singly linked list to manage labyrinth paths with methods to add, remove locations, and check for loops.

3. **ScrollStack**: Developed a stack for ancient scrolls with operations for adding, removing, and checking the existence of scrolls.

4. **ExplorerQueue**: Implemented a circular queue to manage explorers entering the temple with enqueue, dequeue, and status checking functions.

5. **ClueTree**: Built a binary tree structure for clues with various traversal methods, clue searching, and counting.

## Design Decisions

- The array in `ArtifactVault` is kept sorted for efficient binary search.
- The linked list in `LabyrinthPath` allows for dynamic resizing.
- The `ScrollStack` and `ExplorerQueue` classes provide essential stack and queue functionalities while maintaining encapsulation.

## Running the Code

To run the code, compile each class and execute the main method or create test cases for each
